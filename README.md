# Simulations & Modeling: Understanding Systems Through Code

A hands-on course for ages 16-20 that teaches how to understand real-world systems through building simulations.

## 🎯 Course Philosophy

**Code is a way to think, not just calculate.**

This course emphasizes:
- **Rules → Behavior → Outcomes**: Start with simple rules and watch complex patterns emerge
- **Visual feedback is essential**: See what your code does in real-time
- **Iteration and experimentation**: Learn by playing and adjusting parameters
- **Minimal math, maximum insight**: Focus on concepts, not complex equations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming skills (variables, loops, functions)
- Ages 16-20
- Curiosity about how systems work!

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrMichel93/Simulations-Modeling.git
cd Simulations-Modeling
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start with Module 1 and work your way through!

## 📚 Course Structure

### Module 1: Foundations
**What are simulations?**
- Understanding deterministic vs stochastic models
- Core concepts: randomness, time steps, state, emergent behavior
- Your first simulation

### Module 2: Dice & Probability
**Rolling the dice on reality**
- Experiment with random events
- Understand probability through code
- Predict vs observe outcomes

### Module 3: Random Walks
**The drunkard's walk**
- Model random movement
- Discover surprising patterns
- Applications: diffusion, stock prices, particle physics

### Module 4: Predator-Prey
**The hunt is on**
- Balance between species
- Cyclic population dynamics
- Parameter tuning and ecosystem stability

### Module 5: Traffic Flow
**Rush hour simulation**
- Simple rules create traffic jams
- Emergent behavior from individual decisions
- What-if analysis: adding lanes, changing speeds

### Module 6: Disease Spread
**Epidemic modeling**
- SIR model: Susceptible, Infected, Recovered
- How diseases spread through networks
- Impact of interventions

## 🎨 Visualizations

Each module includes:
- **Graphs**: Track changes over time
- **Animations**: Watch behavior unfold
- **Grid displays**: See spatial patterns

## 🧪 Learning Approach

### 1. Predict
Before running code, guess what will happen

### 2. Run
Execute the simulation and observe

### 3. Reflect
Explain results in plain English - what surprised you?

### 4. Experiment
Change parameters and see what happens

### 5. Create
Build your own variations

## 🎮 Challenges & Projects

Each module contains:
- **Guided Challenges**: Step-by-step exercises
- **Open-ended Sandbox**: Create your own simulations
- **Parameter Experiments**: Systematic exploration

## 📊 Assessment

Success means you can:
1. **Explain** why simulations behave the way they do
2. **Predict** outcomes before running code
3. **Design** experiments to test hypotheses
4. **Create** your own simple simulations

No tests or quizzes - just understanding and creativity!

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Start small**: Run the basic examples first
- **Break things**: Modify code and see what breaks (that's how you learn!)
- **Visualize everything**: If you can't see it, you can't understand it
- **Ask "what if?"**: The best learning comes from curiosity
- **Share discoveries**: Discuss surprising results with peers
