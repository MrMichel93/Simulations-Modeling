# Assessment Guide

## Course Philosophy on Assessment

**Traditional tests don't work well for simulation-based learning.**

Instead, assessment focuses on:
- **Understanding** over memorization
- **Explanation** over calculation
- **Exploration** over rote completion
- **Creativity** over conformity

## Assessment Framework

### Three Pillars of Success

#### 1. Conceptual Understanding
Can you explain what's happening and why?

#### 2. Experimental Thinking
Can you design and run meaningful experiments?

#### 3. Creative Application
Can you build new simulations or adapt existing ones?

## Assessment Methods

### 1. Reflection Questions (Per Module)

After each module, students should be able to answer:

**Explain**
- What is this simulation modeling?
- What are the key rules/parameters?
- Why does the system behave this way?

**Predict**
- What will happen if I change X?
- What patterns should emerge?
- What's the relationship between variables?

**Connect**
- How does this relate to the real world?
- What other systems behave similarly?
- What are the limitations of this model?

### 2. Experimental Notebooks

Students maintain a notebook documenting:

**For Each Experiment:**
- Hypothesis (what I predict)
- Parameters used
- Observations (what happened)
- Analysis (why it happened)
- Next question (what to try next)

**Example Entry:**
```
Experiment: Effect of growth rate on population

Hypothesis: Higher growth rate → faster population increase

Parameters:
- growth_rate = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15
- initial_population = 100
- time_steps = 100

Observations:
- 0.05: Reached 432 at step 100
- 0.10: Reached 1,803 at step 100
- 0.15: Reached 7,458 at step 100

Analysis:
Doubling growth rate more than doubles final population!
This is exponential growth - small rate changes have huge impacts.

Next question:
What growth rate leads to exactly 1000 at step 100?
```

### 3. Module Challenges

Each module includes exercises that test understanding:

**Completion Criteria:**
- Code runs without errors
- Results are reasonable
- Student can explain the results
- Parameters were experimented with

**Not Required:**
- Perfect code style
- Optimal implementation
- Matching exact numbers

### 4. Final Projects

Choose one:

#### Option A: Deep Dive
Pick one module and go deeper:
- Add complexity to the model
- Test a research question
- Compare to real-world data
- Write up findings

#### Option B: New Simulation
Create a simulation of your own:
- Define the system and rules
- Implement in code
- Visualize results
- Explain insights gained

#### Option C: Multi-System
Combine concepts from multiple modules:
- Integrate different ideas
- Create something novel
- Show emergent behavior

**Project Requirements:**
1. Clear documentation
2. Working code
3. Visualizations
4. Written explanation of insights
5. Reflection on process

### 5. Peer Discussion

Students explain their work to peers:
- Demonstrate their simulation
- Explain their findings
- Answer questions
- Discuss applications

**Assessment:** Can they communicate clearly?

## Rubric for Understanding

### Excellent Understanding
- Explains behavior in own words clearly
- Makes accurate predictions
- Designs meaningful experiments
- Identifies connections to real systems
- Asks insightful "what if" questions

### Good Understanding
- Explains basic concepts correctly
- Makes reasonable predictions
- Runs experiments systematically
- Sees some real-world connections
- Modifies parameters meaningfully

### Developing Understanding
- Describes what code does literally
- Struggles to predict outcomes
- Experiments randomly
- Connections superficial
- Needs guidance to explore

### Needs Support
- Can't explain simulation behavior
- No predictions or all wrong
- Doesn't experiment
- No connections made
- Stuck on technical issues

## Grading Guidelines

### If Grades Are Required

**Participation (30%)**
- Completes module exercises
- Maintains experimental notebook
- Engages with material

**Understanding (40%)**
- Reflection question responses
- Quality of explanations
- Prediction accuracy improves over time

**Project (30%)**
- Working simulation
- Depth of exploration
- Quality of communication
- Creativity and effort

### Better Alternative: Specifications Grading

**Pass/Fail on specific competencies:**

✅ Can implement a basic simulation
✅ Can visualize simulation results
✅ Can explain emergent behavior
✅ Can design parameter experiments
✅ Can predict simulation outcomes
✅ Can connect simulations to real systems
✅ Completed final project

All ✅ = Full mastery
Most ✅ = Strong understanding
Some ✅ = Developing
Few ✅ = Needs more time

## Self-Assessment Questions

Students regularly reflect:

**Knowledge**
- What concepts do I understand well?
- What am I still confused about?
- What surprised me most?

**Skills**
- What can I code independently?
- What do I need help with?
- How have my debugging skills improved?

**Attitude**
- Am I curious and asking questions?
- Do I experiment beyond requirements?
- Am I thinking like a scientist?

## Portfolio Approach

Students create a portfolio containing:

1. **Code samples** from each module
2. **Experimental notebook** with entries
3. **Visualizations** they created
4. **Final project** with documentation
5. **Reflection essay** on learning journey

Portfolio demonstrates growth over time.

## Red Flags vs Green Flags

### 🚩 Red Flags
- Only runs code once without exploring
- Can't explain why results occur
- Frustrated when code doesn't work perfectly
- Avoids experimentation
- Wants "the right answer"

### 🟢 Green Flags
- Tries multiple parameter values
- Notices and investigates patterns
- Curious about "what if" scenarios
- Comfortable with iteration
- Sees mistakes as learning opportunities

## Intervention Strategies

### If Student Struggles:

**With Concepts:**
- Return to simpler examples
- Use physical analogies
- Draw diagrams together
- Pair with peer mentor

**With Code:**
- Focus on one piece at a time
- Add print statements to see what's happening
- Start with working code, modify gradually
- Don't worry about elegance

**With Motivation:**
- Connect to their interests
- Choose relevant real-world examples
- Celebrate small successes
- Make it playful

## Assessment Timeline

### Weekly
- Complete module exercises
- Add entries to experimental notebook

### Bi-weekly
- Reflection question responses
- Quick check-ins

### End of Course
- Final project
- Portfolio review
- Peer presentations

## Success Criteria

A student has succeeded if they:

1. **Understand** how simulations reveal system behavior
2. **Can build** simple simulations from scratch
3. **Think experimentally** about parameters and outcomes
4. **Communicate** insights in plain language
5. **See connections** between models and reality
6. **Are curious** about complex systems

**Most importantly: They want to keep exploring!**

## Beyond the Grade

The real assessment is:
- Will they use simulation to understand future problems?
- Have they developed computational thinking?
- Do they see the world as systems of interacting rules?
- Are they more comfortable with complexity?

These are the lasting outcomes that matter.

## For Instructors

### Assessment Principles

1. **Value exploration** over correctness
2. **Reward curiosity** and experimentation
3. **Assess understanding** through explanation
4. **Encourage iteration** and revision
5. **Make it low-stakes** to reduce anxiety
6. **Focus on growth** not perfection

### Keep It Human

This is about helping young people:
- Think computationally
- Understand complexity
- Build confidence with code
- See systems everywhere

Grades are a tool, not the goal.

### Flexibility

Adapt assessment to your context:
- Formal classroom
- Informal workshop
- Self-paced online
- Summer camp

The key: Did they learn to think with code?
