# Sandbox: Your Simulation Playground

This is YOUR space to experiment, create, and explore!

## 🎮 Philosophy

**Play is how we learn best.**

Use this folder to:
- Try wild ideas
- Break things (on purpose!)
- Build custom simulations
- Remix existing code
- Test hypotheses
- Create art with code

**There are no wrong answers here.**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Copy and Modify

Start with an existing simulation:
```bash
cp ../modules/02_dice_probability/roll_dice.py my_experiment.py
```

Then change it! What if dice had 20 sides? What if some numbers were weighted?

### 2. Combine Concepts

Mix ideas from different modules:
- Random walk + predator-prey = foraging animals
- Traffic + disease = disease spread on transportation network
- Dice + traffic = stochastic traffic lights

### 3. Build from Scratch

Start with a blank file and create something new!

## 💡 Project Ideas

### Easy Challenges

1. **Loaded Dice**
   - Create unfair dice
   - How many rolls to detect the bias?

2. **Brownian Motion**
   - Particles bouncing randomly
   - Beautiful visualization

3. **Simple Life**
   - Organisms eat food, reproduce, die
   - Balance birth and death rates

### Medium Challenges

4. **Forest Fire**
   - Trees, fire, regrowth
   - Watch patterns emerge
   - Grid-based simulation

5. **Game of Life**
   - Conway's classic cellular automaton
   - Simple rules, complex behavior

6. **Flocking Birds**
   - Three rules: separation, alignment, cohesion
   - Watch coordinated motion emerge

7. **Rumor Spread**
   - Like disease spread, but for information
   - Add skeptics and believers

### Hard Challenges

8. **Economic Market**
   - Buyers and sellers
   - Supply and demand
   - Emergent price formation

9. **Evolution Simulation**
   - Creatures with genes
   - Mutation and selection
   - Watch adaptation happen

10. **Complex Ecosystem**
    - Multiple species
    - Food web
    - Competition and cooperation

## 🎯 Challenge Format

For each project you tackle:

### 1. Define the Question
What are you trying to understand?

### 2. Identify the Rules
What are the fundamental behaviors?

### 3. Implement
Write the code!

### 4. Visualize
Make it visual - graphs, grids, animations

### 5. Experiment
Change parameters, test hypotheses

### 6. Explain
Write a short explanation of what you learned

## 📝 Documentation Template

Use this structure for your projects:

```python
"""
PROJECT TITLE

Description: What this simulates

Question: What I'm trying to understand

Rules:
  1. First rule
  2. Second rule
  3. etc.

Parameters to explore:
  - parameter1: what it affects
  - parameter2: what it affects

Expected outcomes:
  - What I predict will happen

Actual results:
  - What actually happened
  - Surprises and insights
"""
```

## 🌟 Share Your Work

Created something cool?
1. Document it well
2. Add visualizations
3. Write about what you learned
4. Consider submitting a pull request to add it to the course!

## 🧪 Scientific Method

Even in play, be systematic:

1. **Hypothesis**: I think X will happen because Y
2. **Experiment**: Run simulation with these parameters
3. **Observe**: Record what actually happens
4. **Analyze**: Why did it happen? Match hypothesis?
5. **Iterate**: What's the next question?

## 🎨 Creative Mode

Simulations can also be art!

- Create beautiful patterns
- Make interactive animations
- Generate procedural art
- Visualize music or sound

Code as creative medium!

## 💭 Reflection Questions

As you work, think about:
- What surprised me?
- What patterns emerged?
- How does this relate to the real world?
- What would I try next?
- What did I learn about complex systems?
